## PRE_CALCULATE_REPO_STATUS
Remove application and authorization group from open-source programs before comparing to find differences.

# Legacy branch: ecc
The root package name in ECC is different from the root package name in S/4 HANA.  
Branch ecc should not be merged into main.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome, in particular improvement suggestions to either the code or this documentat.

Be aware, though, that the main purpose for making this repository public was to share back to the open source ABAP community, not to develop a common solution.
Each organization will have different requirements, so although you may find inspiration in this implementation it is not likely that you can apply it directly in your SAP system.

# Choice of license
This repository contains code for user exits in abapGit and therefore uses the same license as abapGit.
